Create USB Boot Drives
======================

Overview
-------------
For the initial SecureDrop setup, you will need three USB drives.

Two of them will be used for the Tails operating system,
for creating the *Admin Workstation* and *Secure Viewing Station*.

The other USB drive will have the Ubuntu Server installer,
which is needed to install the underlying server OS for your
*Application* and *Monitor Servers*.

.. important:: As soon as you create a new drive, be sure to
    *label it immediately*. USB drives all look alike and you're
    going to be juggling a whole bunch of them throughout this
    installation. Label immediately. Always.

Tails Introduction
------------------

`Tails <https://tails.boum.org>`__ is a privacy-enhancing live operating
system that runs on removable media, such as a DVD or a USB stick. It
sends all your Internet traffic through Tor, does not touch your
computer's hard drive, and securely wipes unsaved work on shutdown.

Most of the work of installing, administering, and using SecureDrop is
done from computers using Tails, so the first thing you need to do is
set up several USB drives with the Tails operating system. To get
started, you'll need two Tails drives: one for the *Admin Workstation*
and one for the *Secure Viewing Station*. :doc:`Later <onboarding_journalists>`,
you'll set up a bunch more Tails drives for your journalists and
backups, but for now you just need two.



.. _setup_install_tails:

Install Tails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Tails website <https://tails.boum.org/>`__ has detailed and
up-to-date instructions on how to download and verify Tails, and how to
create a bootable Tails USB drive.

Follow the instructions at these links and then return to this page:

-  `Download and verify the Tails image
   file <https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html>`__
-  `Install onto a USB drive <https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html>`__

.. important:: Make sure you verify the Tails .img file using one of the methods
   described on the Tails website.

You will need to create 2 Tails USBs to perform the SecureDrop installation:

#. The *Secure Viewing Station* Tails USB.
#. The *Admin Workstation* Tails USB.

.. tip:: This process will take some time, most of which will be spent
	 waiting around.

Enable Persistent Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, everything you save while running Tails will be securely
erased and discarded when you power off or reboot your system.

Because we will need to keep certain settings and files saved between
sessions, you will need to enable persistence.

Creating an encrypted persistent volume will allow you to securely save
information and settings in the free space that is left on your Tails
drive. You will need to create a persistent storage on each Tails drive. Each
drive's persistent storage partition needs its own unique, complex 
passphrase that's easy to write down or remember. 

For instructions on how to generate a strong passphrase, see :doc:`the 
Passphrases page <passphrases>`.

Please use the instructions on the `Tails website
<https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html>`__
to make the persistent volume on each Tails drive you create. When
creating the persistence volume, you will be asked to select from a
list of features, such as 'Personal Data'. You should enable **all** features by
selecting each item in the list.

Some other things to keep in mind:

-  Right now, you need to create a persistent volume on both the *Admin
   Workstation* Tails drive and the *Secure Viewing Station* Tails
   drive.

-  Each journalist will need their own Tails drive with their own
   persistent volume secured with their own passphrase â€” but :doc:`that comes
   later <onboarding_journalists>`.
   
.. note:: Tails doesn't always completely shut down and reboot
	  properly when you click "restart", so if you notice a
	  significant delay, you may have to manually power off and
	  restart your computer for it to work properly.

.. warning:: Make sure that you never use the *Secure Viewing Station*
	     Tails drive on a computer connected to the Internet or a
	     local network. This Tails drive will only be used on the
	     air-gapped *Secure Viewing Station*.
   
  
Ubuntu Introduction
-------------------

.. note:: Installing Ubuntu is simple and may even be something you are very familiar
  with, but it is **strongly** encouraged that you read and follow this documentation
  exactly as there are some "gotchas" that may cause your SecureDrop setup to break.

The SecureDrop *Application Server* and *Monitor Server* run **Ubuntu Server
20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)**. To install Ubuntu on the servers, you must first
download and verify the Ubuntu installation media.

.. _download_ubuntu:

Download the Ubuntu Installation Media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installation media and the files required to verify it are available on the
`Ubuntu Releases page`_. You will need to download the following files:

* `ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso`_
* `SHA256SUMS`_
* `SHA256SUMS.gpg`_

Alternatively, you can use the command line:

.. code:: sh

   cd ~/Downloads
   curl -OOO https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.5/{ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso,SHA256SUMS{,.gpg}}

.. _Ubuntu Releases page: https://releases.ubuntu.com/
.. _ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso
.. _SHA256SUMS: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
.. _SHA256SUMS.gpg: https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS.gpg

Verify the Ubuntu Installation Media
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should verify the Ubuntu image you downloaded hasn't been modified by
a malicious attacker or otherwise corrupted. To do so, check its integrity with
cryptographic signatures and hashes.

First, download both *Ubuntu Image Signing Keys* and verify their
fingerprints. ::

    gpg --recv-key --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com \
    "C598 6B4F 1257 FFA8 6632 CBA7 4618 1433 FBB7 5451" \
    "8439 38DF 228D 22F7 B374 2BC0 D94A A3F0 EFE2 1092"

.. note:: It is important you type this out correctly. If you are not
          copy-pasting this command, double-check you have
          entered it correctly before pressing enter.

Again, when passing the full public key fingerprint to the ``--recv-key`` command, GPG
will implicitly verify that the fingerprint of the key received matches the
argument passed.

.. caution:: If GPG warns you that the fingerprint of the key received
             does not match the one requested **do not** proceed with
             the installation. If this happens, please email us at
             securedrop@freedom.press.

Next, verify the ``SHA256SUMS`` file. ::

    gpg --keyid-format long --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS

Move on to the next step if you see "Good Signature" in the output, as
below. Note that any other message (such as "Can't check signature: no public
key") means that you are not ready to proceed. ::

    gpg: Signature made Thu 11 Feb 2021 02:07:58 PM EST
    gpg:                using RSA key 843938DF228D22F7B3742BC0D94AA3F0EFE21092
    gpg: Good signature from "Ubuntu CD Image Automatic Signing Key (2012) <cdimage@ubuntu.com>" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 8439 38DF 228D 22F7 B374  2BC0 D94A A3F0 EFE2 1092

The next and final step is to verify the Ubuntu image. ::

    sha256sum -c <(grep ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso SHA256SUMS)

If the final verification step is successful, you should see the
following output in your terminal. ::

    ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso: OK

.. caution:: If you do not see the line above it is not safe to proceed with the
             installation. If this happens, please contact us at
             securedrop@freedom.press.
